## purpose
 Its a website for a company that has reputation repair services. 
Refactored  the code for a landing page for the website from starter code.
Added alt tags, adjusted some text, and text boxes.
For the css code I refactored and consolidated some of the code.
Built with 
*HTML
*CSS

I learned alot from this project, mainly how to clean up the code.
I also learned that making changes to existing code, can be harder than writing it from scratch.
